Notes:
This middleware uses the jsonwebtoken library to verify JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
When a protected route uses this middleware, it expects a valid JWT token in the Authorization header of the HTTP request.
The middleware verifies the token's validity and attaches the user object to the request for further processing in route handlers.
If the token is invalid or missing, it sends a 401 Unauthorized response.
